1. CPU Utilization
    a. 100%
    b. Since neither process issues an I/O request, Process 0 runs completely first, then Process 1 runs.
2. Completion Time
    a. 400 ms
    b. Process 0
        cpu (100 ms)
        cpu (100 ms)
        cpu (100 ms)
        cpu (100 ms)

       Process 1
        io (0 ms)
       Total = 400 ms
3. Process Order
    a. No
    b. Regardless of which command is run one process will use 400 ms of CPU time and the other will use 0 ms (see above).
4. Switching Policies
    a. SWITCH ON END
        a1. No
        a2. SWITCH_ON_END enforces that behavior by allowing a process to continue executing until it completes its current activity (either CPU-bound or I/O-bound) before switching to another process.
    b. SWITCH ON IO
        b1. Yes
        b2. SWITCH_ON_IO causes the scheduler to immediately switch away from a process as soon as it issues an I/O request, giving the CPU to another process.
5. I/O Completion Policies
    a. IO_RUN_LATER
        a1. Yes
        a2. This policy reduces CPU utilization because, while the process that just completed I/O remains unscheduled, the CPU might remain idle until another process is available to run.
    b. IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE
        b1. Yes
        b2. By allowing the process that just completed I/O to run immediately, the system minimizes CPU idle time.
