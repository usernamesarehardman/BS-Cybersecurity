Part 1
1. Generate the Job Set
    Job 0 ( length = 5 )
    Job 1 ( length = 3 )
    Job 2 ( length = 2 )
    Job 3 ( length = 3 )
2. Manually Calculate Metrics
    Job 0 ( response = 0, turnaround = 5, wait = 0)
    Job 1 ( response = 5, turnaround = 8, wait = 5)
    Job 2 ( response = 8, turnaround = 10, wait = 8)
    Job 3 ( response = 10, turnaround = 13, wait = 10)
    Avg   ( response = 5.75, turnaround = 9.00, wait = 5.75 )
3. Verify Your Work
    (Completed on paper)

Part 2
1. Generate a New Job Set
    Job 2 ( length = 2 )
    Job 1 ( length = 3 )
    Job 3 ( length = 3 )
    Job 0 ( length = 5 )
    I predict that Job 2 will go first, followed by Job 1, Job 3, and then finally Job 0.
2. Compute and Compare
    I predict that the average wait time will decreease with SJF compared to FIFO.
    Avg   ( response = 3.75, turnaround = 7.00, wait = 3.75 )
    SJF was significantly more effiecient because it lowered the average response, turnaround, and wait times.

Part 3
1. Run RR with a Quantum of 3
    Round robin should initially have the same execution order as FIFO. 
    However, all Jobs except Job 0 will complete on the first run, meaning Job 0  will run one more time.
    Job 0, 1, 2, 3, 0

2. Manually Compute Metrics
    Job 0 ( response = 0, turnaround = 13, wait = 8)
    Job 1 ( response = 3, turnaround = 6, wait = 3)
    Job 2 ( response = 6, turnaround = 8, wait = 6)
    Job 3 ( response = 8, turnaround = 11, wait = 8)
    Avg   ( response = 4.25, turnaround = 9.50, wait = 6.25 )
    decreasing the time quantum can increase average wait time but can reduce average response and turnaround times.
    decreasing the time quantum can reduce average wait time but can decrease average response and turnaround times.
